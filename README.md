# My First Repository
This repository has been created as a part of studing a module called **Git** on a platform of [SkillFactory](https://skillfactory.ru/), and by having been inspired by a clever person who always helps. 

## Distance, Speed, Time 
Using simple formulas you can easily calculate distance, speed and time as below: 
* speed multiplied by time equals ***distance*** 

              v x t = S 

* distance divided by time equals ***speed*** 

              S / t = v 

* distance divided by speed equals ***time***

              S / v = t

### Comments 
At the moment we are studying **Git** module. 
We have already studied about Version Control System, its types, about Git and GitHub, Markdown and Commit. 

There are the following issues that are to be studied: 
* ***Branch*** 
* ***Push*** 
* ***Pull / Fetch*** 
* ***Merge*** 
* ***Additional Git features*** such as ***Amend, Discard, Stash, Cherry-pick, Revert***
