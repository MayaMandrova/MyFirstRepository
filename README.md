# My First Repository
This repository has been created as a part of studing a module called **Git** on a platform of [SkillFactory](https://skillfactory.ru/), and by having been inspired by a clever person who always helps. 

## Distance, Speed, Time 
Using simple formulas you can easily calculate distance, speed and time as below: 
* speed multiplied by time equals ***distance*** 

              v x t = S 

* distance divided by time equals ***speed*** 

              S / t = v 

* distance divided by speed equals ***time***

              S / v = t
